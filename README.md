# Python-Automation-Suite
# 🐍 Multi-Purpose Python Scripts

A collection of **Python automation scripts** designed to handle **security checks**, **email automation**, and **image processing**.  
Each script serves a distinct function and can be used independently or integrated into broader workflows.

## 🧠 Overview

The **Python project** consists of three main scripts:

1. **Password Breach Checker** – Checks if a password has been compromised using the [Have I Been Pwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3) and returns the number of breaches.  
2. **Email Automation** – Automates sending emails using SMTP, supporting multiple recipients and attachments.  
3. **Image Automation** – Processes images automatically using the **Pillow** library, such as resizing, filtering, and format conversion.

These scripts aim to simplify common repetitive tasks while providing security and productivity tools for Python users.
